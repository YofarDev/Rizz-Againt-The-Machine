Choose from multiple LLM models:

* Your local models via Ollama
* Gemini API
* Anthropic API
* OpenAI API
* GROC API

Except for these models, anything else is local and all information is stored in cache.

There are different expressions the avatar can display based on the interactions, and some hidden actions (like moving from a place to another).

Desktop version and Android version may be available soon.
