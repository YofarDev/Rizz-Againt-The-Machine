# Rizz Against The Machine

A small game based on LLMs. 

[Play it for free](https://rizzatm.web.app/).

Earn or lose points based on your rizz (points are arbitrarily assigned by the LLM, so I don't think it's esport ready).

**Warning : it contains NSFW assets (nothing crazy).**

## Features

Choose from multiple LLM models:
- Local models via Ollama
- Popular cloud-based models via API

- Everything is stored locally
- Dynamic avatar expressions based on interactions
- Hidden actions (e.g., location changes)
- Cross-platform support (Web, Desktop, and Android versions available)

Note: The game's quality depends on the chosen LLM model's capabilities and its ability to follow system prompts and maintain character consistency.
